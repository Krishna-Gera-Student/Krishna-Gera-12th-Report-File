# Project Report Programs

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of Python programs designed for a project report. The programs are categorized into two sections: **Python Programs** and **Python MySQL Connectivity Programs**.

### Python Programs

1. **Word Separator:**
   Read a text file line by line and display each word separated by a #.

2. **Character Analysis:**
   Read a text file and display the number of vowels, consonants, uppercase, and lowercase characters.

3. **Remove Lines:**
   Remove all lines containing the character 'a' in a file and write it to another file.

4. **Binary File Search:**
   Create a binary file with name and roll number. Search for a given roll number and display the name.

5. **Update Marks:**
   Create a binary file with roll number, name, and marks. Input a roll number and update the marks.

6. **Dice Simulator:**
   Write a random number generator simulating a dice (numbers between 1 and 6).

7. **Stack Implementation:**
   Implement a stack using a Python list.

8. **CSV User Authentication:**
   Create a CSV file with user-id and password. Read and search the password for a given user-id.

9. **List Rotation:**
   Rotate elements of a list, moving each element to the next position.

10. **User Management:**
    - `addUser()`: Add a new user to a list.
    - `removeUser()`: Delete a user based on user id.
    - `displayUser()`: Display user information based on user id or list all users.

11. **Base Converter:**
    Create a function to convert a decimal number to binary, octal, and hexadecimal equivalents.

12. **Place Names:**
    Create a function to display uppercase names of places with lengths longer than 5 characters.

13. **Word Lengths:**
    Create a function to return the length of each word in a string as a tuple.

14. **Vowel Count:**
    Create a function to count and display the number of vowels in a text file.

15. **Non-Zero Indices:**
    Create a function to return the indices of non-zero elements in a list.

16. **Student Marks:**
    Create a program to push names of students with marks > 75 into a stack and pop/display the stack.

### Python MySQL Connectivity Programs

1. **Display All Books:**
   Connect to the LIBRARY (MySQL) database and display all records from the BOOK Table.

2. **Filtered Member Data:**
   Connect to the LIBRARY (MySQL) database and display records from the MEMBER Table with specific criteria.

3. **Borrowed Books Information:**
   Connect to the LIBRARY (MySQL) database and display names and emails of members who have borrowed books.

4. **Book Issuance:**
   Connect to the LIBRARY (MySQL) database and issue a book to a specific member based on IDs.
