Silent whispers in the night,
Stars shining with gentle light.
Moon's embrace, a silver glow,
Nature's lullaby, soft and low.

Dreams take flight on wings of grace,
Heart's desires in every space.
Whispers carry hopes and fears,
Echoing through the passing years.

Nature's beauty, a timeless song,
Where melodies and hearts belong.
In this moment, let your soul ignite,
Embrace the magic of the night.
